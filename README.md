## Iris Flower Classification

This project aims to develop machine learning models to accurately classify iris flowers into the correct species based on their measurements.

The dataset used contains measurements of various attributes of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following attributes:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

Species (target variable): Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

## Requirements

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

Scikit-learn


## Approach

Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of attributes and the relationships between them.

Data Preprocessing: Handle any missing values, encode categorical variables (if any), and scale the features if necessary.

Model Selection: Choose suitable machine learning algorithms for classification tasks, such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc.

Model Training: Train the selected models on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Comparison: Compare the performance of different models to identify the most effective one for the task.

Deployment: Deploy the chosen model for real-world classification tasks

## Files Included

## Usage

1. Clone the repository

2. Install the required dependencies

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to train and evaluate the machine learning models.

## Results

Random Forest Model:

Accuracy: 96.66%

Precision: 96.66

Recall: 96.66

F1-score: 96.66

Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model:

Accuracy: 96.66%

Precision: 96.66

Recall: 96.66

F1-score: 96.66

## Conclusion

Key Findings:

- Both Random Forest and SVM models performed exceptionally well, achieving identical performance metrics.
- This parity in performance indicates that both algorithms are equally effective in classifying iris flowers.
- Despite their different underlying principles and methodologies, both models were able to generalize equally well to unseen data.
